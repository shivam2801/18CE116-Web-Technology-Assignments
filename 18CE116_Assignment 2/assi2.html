A black hole is a region of spacetime exhibiting gravitational acceleration so strong that nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from it

		<td>What Happens to Matter Inside a Black Hole?</td>
		<td>Black holes- packets of space that contain a large amount of matter compacted into a small area- are one of the most amazing phenomena existent in our universe. Because the matter in a black hole is so dense, the force of gravity within the black hole becomes immensely strong, attracting everything within a certain radius and not even allowing light to escape.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>How Do Black Holes Form?</td>
		<td>Stellar black holes are made when the center of a very big star falls in upon itself, or collapses. When this happens, it causes a supernova. A supernova is an exploding star that blasts part of the star into space.</td>

		<td>How Is NASA Studying Black Holes?</td>
		<td>NASA is using satellites and telescopes that are traveling in space to learn more about black holes. These spacecraft help scientists answer questions about the universe.</td>
